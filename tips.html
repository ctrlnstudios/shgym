    <h2>DONT MAKE THIS POST EXERCISE MISTAKE</h2>
        </div>
    <br>
        <p class="ctxt">

The gyms are finally reopening. Spin classes are already being scheduled. Yes, we can go back to working out in our favourite fitness centers again and it feels great. At the same time, it’s important to practice social distancing protocols as mandated by the government.
<br><br>
While many of us are enthusiastic about returning to a gym environment again to shed those “quarantine gains”, many of us might commit some post-exercise recovery mistakes in our excitement.
<br><br>
Which may result in actually hurting our weight loss efforts, and likely to get us injured. Which is why we need to avoid these mistakes, and the first step to correcting mistakes is to identify them<span id="dots">.</span>
            <span id="more">
<br><br>
<h7>What are the common post-exercise recovery mistakes?</h7>
            <br><br>
<h8>Not cooling down enough</h8><br>
Rushing to finish a workout is not a good thing. We need to give our body enough time to recover. Some people – particularly those who squeeze in their workout sessions during lunch breaks – actually even skip the cooldown part of their workout and head straight to the shower.
<br>
Our temperature rises and blood vessels open up more during physical activities (running, exercising, etc.) and cool-down exercises help get them back to their normal state. Not giving your muscles enough time to cool down will cause blood to pool in your body’s lower extremities.
<br>
Your blood won’t have as much pressure for it to be pumped back to your heart and your brain. Use a fitness tracker to check your heart rate, which should be around 60-80 before you stop your workout.
<br><br>
<h8>Too much sports drinks</h8><br>
Staying hydrated after working out is hands down – very important. But reaching for that bottle of sports drink during and post workout isn’t exactly the best option.
<br>
Sports drinks actually contain carbohydrates and calories which athletes need in order to power through intense training sessions or events. So unless you are training for a marathon or just completed a really tough workout that lasted more than an hour, you are actually taking in more calories than you burned by reaching for a sports drink after working out.
<br>
Stick to plain water to rehydrate. You can also add a tiny pinch of salt in your drinking water to replenish electrolytes after your gym session or cycle class, and keep the sports drinks at a minimum. A recommended amount is a mouthful of isotonic sports drink for every 15 minutes of hard exercise.
<br><br>
<h8>Not eating after working out</h8><br>
Or more specifically, waiting too long after a workout to eat your next meal. Refueling your body after a workout session is important for recovery. Not only do you need to replenish the energy you used, you need to eat so your body can repair the micro tears in your muscles caused by exercise.
<br>
Get carbohydrates and proteins within two hours of your workout. Sooner, if you just did a really intense session that lasted for an hour or so. Carbohydrates replenish your energy stores, protein helps with muscle recovery and strength. Don’t wait too long to get your post-workout meal.
<br><br>
            <h8>Scheduling another training session the next day</h8><br>
Contrary to popular belief you don’t have to pump iron or sweat through a 90-minute cycle class every day to be healthy. There is such a thing as overtraining and even star athletes understand the importance of incorporating rest days in their training sessions.
<br>
If you do not set a time for recovery, your muscles will not get the chance to heal. If muscles don’t get to heal, it doesn’t get stronger. That’s why working out every day might defeat the purpose of building strength and toning up muscles.
<br>
Instead, switch up intense workout sessions with lighter activities. Go for long walks or do stretching exercises the next day so you can keep a healthy blood flow to those sore muscles. If you must do active recovery exercises, avoid using the same muscles from your tough workouts.
<br>
<h8>Not getting a post workout massage</h8><br>
Getting a massage after working out is helpful in reducing muscle soreness and pain. It is also a great way to relax after an intense workout session, and helps a lot in easing anxiety and stress. Now, not all gyms offer post workout massage services and it can be a bit of a hassle to squeeze in a session with a massage therapist after your workout. Also, social distancing rules are still in effect, so doing a self-massage after your workout is the best option.
<br>
Using sports recovery devices like a massage gun is a good way to ease those post workout pains and soreness. These devices use percussive force to drive vibrations deep into muscle tissue. These breaks down the lactic acid build up in the muscles which minimize inflammation and pain.
<br>
Massage guns are very portable and can easily fit in your gym bag. You can take it out after working out to ease post-exercise inflammation or use it during your workout between reps to keep your muscles warmed up and ready.
<br><br>
<h7>Conclusion</h7><br>
There you have it. Some of the most common post exercise mistakes that many of us make. Keep in mind that what we do after working out is as important as the actual workout itself. And we need to make sure what we do outside the gym is not putting all of our hard work to waste.

    <h2>GETTING THE RIGHT NUTRIENTS</h2>
        </div>
    <br>
        <p class="ctxt">

It is not easy to sustain my fitness goals. I mean, I’ve been trying relatively hard over the past year to get back in shape but I am still far fetched from the fitspo I once was. I never want to give up my resolution in getting back in better shape.

I run, I gym and I try different ways to reduce my calorie intake. It is a no brainer that a combination of a well-balanced diet and exercise makes up the no-so-secret recipe to fitness. Of course, those who know me well knows that fitness might be something I yearn for but in fact, I was more inclined towards sustaining an active and healthy lifestyle. You have to be healthy and energetic to continue the endless struggle to full fitness<span id="dots">.</span>
            <span id="more">
<br><br>
So where do I get the vitality from? Well, I turn to Centrum, the world’s no. 1 multivitamin brand for assistance. Here is the review based on what I think about Centrum.
                <br><br>
                Centrum for Men is complete multivitamin specially formulated for men. Men and women have different body compositions and nutritional needs so I have to make sure that I am having the adequate and correct intake of nutrients. This multivitamin contains over 20 important nutrients that I find beneficial
<br><br>
It contains Vitamin B which plays an important role in converting protein, fats and carbohydrates into the energy I require for my runs and workouts. Furthermore, the Vitamins B6, D and magnesium help promote healthy muscles and hence doubling the recovery time I need before my next workout.
<br><br>
It needs no health scientist to advise you how crucial the role a strong heart plays while engaging in endurance sport. The lycopene, Vitamins B6, B12 and folic acids found in the multivitamin provides the necessary support. For those who ain’t an endurance athlete of any sort, these nutrients are still helpful since a strong heart translates into a lower risk of heart attack. 
                <br><br>
                On top of my multivitamins, I will start the day with a packet of Centrum Vitamin C 1000mg. All I need to do is to grab one sachet and pour the content into the cup of water. It’s part of my daily morning routine immediately upon waking up because I believe that an intake of water on an empty stomach will boost metabolic rate by 24% — especially important for someone like me with pathetically low metabolism.
<br><br>
The Centrum Vitamin C 1000mg is a delicious way to get my daily dose of immunity. It contains actual fruit juice extract. Every fizzy sip supports the immune system further with all the essential nutrients, electrolytes, and antioxidants that fill my nutritional gap in a refreshing burst of citrusy goodness.
<br><br>
Furthermore, as a runner, Vitamin C proves to be the key to sustaining performance as well as aiding in recovering. Vitamin C forms a protein which makes our tendons, ligaments and blood vessels. In addition, it helps to metabolise protein and repair the muscle fibre that might have been damaged by the long, exhausting run.
